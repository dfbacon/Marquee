r61 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "Drawing from the relatively invisible literary talents of Daphne DuMaurier and Evan Hunter, Alfred Hitchcock has fashioned a major work of cinematic art, and 'cinematic' is the operative term here, not 'literary' or 'sociological.'", movie_id: m6.id)
r62 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "Few films depict so eerily yet so meticulously the metaphysical and historical sense of a world out of joint.", movie_id: m6.id)
r63 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "Hitch's much misappreciated follow-up to Psycho is arguably the greatest of all disaster films -- a triumph of special effects, as well as the fountainhead of what has become known as gross-out horror.", movie_id: m6.id)
r64 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "The true genius of the film, based on a 1952 short story by Daphne du Maurier, is the way Hitchcock makes the malevolent birds seem like manifestations of his characters' mental unease.", movie_id: m6.id)
r65 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "The picture pursues these false clues with excessive long-windedness and occasional fatuity. It is a tribute to Hitchcock's mastery of his craft that, even so, he makes overpoweringly real the menace of the birds.", movie_id: m6.id)
r66 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "In the thick of an impeccable narrative that pays deep attention to all those involved, the great filmmaker manages to reach far inside the psychological chasm and find a rich inspiration.", movie_id: m6.id)
r67 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "Though it lacks the psychological depth of Hitchcock's greatest works, it's characterised by a nightmarish simplicity.", movie_id: m6.id)
r68 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "This Hitchcock classic somehow strayed from favour for a while, yet in the realm of popular mythology it is now rivalled only by Vertigo or Psycho.", movie_id: m6.id)
r69 = Review.create(username: 'Testing', rating: 5, body: "The Birds represents better than any other Hitchcock film the extreme polarities of his universe: vicious unpredictability and moral and emotional disorder on the one hand, and rigorous stylistic control and formal organization, on the other.", movie_id: m6.id)
